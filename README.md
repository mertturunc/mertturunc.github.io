This blog is heavily inspired by and based on [Nikita Prokopov's blog](https://github.com/tonsky/tonsky.github.io). I really liked his minimalist design and approach, so I used his repository as a foundation while building my own blog.

## prerequisites for development
- ruby 2.7.x (recommended for github pages compatibility)
- bundler (`gem install bundler`)
